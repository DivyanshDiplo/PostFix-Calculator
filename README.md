# PostFix-Calculator
This is a collage assignment i attempted. Below you will get the problem statement. Download COL106-A2.pdf for detail explanation.

## Postfix Notation
Reverse Polish notation (RPN), also known as reverse Łukasiewicz notation, Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands, in contrast to prefix or Polish notation (PN), in which operators precede their operands. The notation does not need any parentheses for as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands.
  - Example to add 3 and 4 together, the expression is 3 4 + rather than 3 + 4.
  - The conventional notation expression 3 − 4 + 5 becomes 3 4 − 5 + in reverse Polish notation: 4 is first subtracted from 3, then 5 is added to it.

## How to Attempt this question
As you can observe that solution to this problem can be implemented using stacks or arrays or linkedList data structure
These 3 implementations are in 
  - For stacks => Part A/stack_a.cpp
  - For stacks implemented using arrays => Part B/stack_b.cpp
  - For stacks implemented using doublyLinkedList => Part C/stack_c.cpp, node_c.cpp, and list.cpp
